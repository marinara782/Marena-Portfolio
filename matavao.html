        <h3> 🐼 Mochi Bamboo Shipping Program</h3>

                <a href = "https://github.com/marinara782/Shipment-Program"><img src = "images/ChatGPT Image Oct 30, 2025, 03_37_25 PM.png" class = "website-image">
                </a>
                <p class = "website-details">A simple C project showcasing my C abilities in a shipping program. This program had to implement a system that tracks bamboo inventory, updates stock, 
                    and analyzes usage patterns. It helped exmphasize pointer manipulation, dynamic arrays, linked lists,
                    file I/O, and data structure handling. </p>

                </a>
                <p class = "website-details">A java console RPG that was built to help practice Object-Oriented Programming more!
                    This was a fun idea that I wanted to create a cute game that would help me test my abilities to understand
                    what I have learned! I created it so that players can choose a class either Barbarian, Mage, or Archer (default if none chosen)
                    and battle my enemy that I had created! Each character type has unique stats and attack behavior so I made some a little goofy
                    while others may potentially be broken.
